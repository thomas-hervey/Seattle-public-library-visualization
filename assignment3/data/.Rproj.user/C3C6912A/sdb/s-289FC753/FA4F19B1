The El Nino plot has a more random distribution with only a slightly positive correlation (as can be seen by open areas in the top left and bottom right of the plot). There hasn’t been significant statistical change. On the otherhand, the NorthEast Pacific plot shows a far less random distribution. Before the 1930s, most temperatures are below 15.5°c, while after the 1930s, most temperatures are steady and above 15.5°c. It seems as though there is more variation every twenty five years or so, as if the temperature has an oscillation.\n\nThe lag correlation for the El Nino region = 0.0298 while the NorthEast Pacific region = 0.6107. These are very different suggesting that the NorthEast Pacific has a more statistically significant correlation from year to year. After plotting both region’s z-scores, it appears that the previous regions results aren’t as similar. It appears that both sets of z-scores are slightly positive over time. In addition, they both follow the same positive and negative trends from year to year; that is, both regions see warmer and cooler temperatures concurrently most of the time. There may possibly be a lag between the two regions with the El Nino closely following the NorthEast Pacific. There may be causation.\n\n\n###2)###\n```{r}\n\nzn = (dec_EN_SST- mean(dec_EN_SST)) / sd(dec_EN_SST)\nzb = (dec_NP_SST- mean(dec_NP_SST)) / sd(dec_NP_SST)\n\nplot(year,zn, lty=1, col=\"red\", lwd=1, main=\"December El Nino & NE Pacific SSTs\", ylab=\"Sea Surface Temperatures [Z-Scores]\", xlab=\"Years\", ylim=c(-3,3))\nlines(year, zn, col=\"red\")\npoints(year, zb, lty=1, col=\"blue\", lwd=1)\nlines(year, zb, col=\"blue\")\n\nlegend(\"topleft\", ncol=2, legend=c(\"El Nino\", \"Blob\"), col=c(\"red\", \"Blue\"), lwd=1, cex=.5)\n\nprob_EN_2015 = 100*dnorm(tail(zn, n=1))\nprob_NP_2015 = 100*dnorm(tail(zb, n=1))\n```\nThe 2015 z-scores for El Nino and NorthEast Pacific are **1.255%** and **4.952%** respectively. The probabilities of these z-scores are **1.2553%** and **4.9523%** respectively. It can be safely suggested that these 2015 events are extreme. As of now, we are assuming that there isn’t any correlation between the two regions, and that they do not affect each other. We will investigate this shortly.\n\n\n###3)###\n```{r, echo=FALSE}\npar(mfrow=c(2,2))\npar(oma=c(0,0,2,0))\n\nhist(zn,breaks=20, col= \"red\", prob= TRUE, main=\"December El Nino SSTs, 20 breaks\", xlab=\"Z-score\")\ncurve(dnorm(x, mean=mean(zn), sd=sd(zn)), \n          col=\"black\", lwd=2, add=TRUE, yaxt=\"n\")\nlegend(\"topleft\", ncol=2, legend=c(\"20 breaks\"), col=c(\"red\"), lwd=1, cex=.2)\n\nhist(zb,breaks=20, col= \"blue\",prob= TRUE,main=\"December North Pacific SSTs, 20 breaks\", xlab=\"Z-score\")\ncurve(dnorm(x, mean=mean(zb), sd=sd(zb)), \n          col=\"black\", lwd=2, add=TRUE, yaxt=\"n\")\nlegend(\"topleft\", ncol=2, legend=c(\"20 breaks\"), col=c(\"blue\"), lwd=1, cex=.2)\n\nhist(zn,breaks=15, col=\"red\", prob= TRUE, main=\"December El Nino SSTs, 15 breaks\", xlab=\"Z-score\")\ncurve(dnorm(x, mean=mean(zn), sd=sd(zn)), \n          col=\"black\", lwd=2, add=TRUE, yaxt=\"n\")\nlegend(\"topleft\", ncol=2, legend=c(\"15 breaks\"), col=c(\"red\"), lwd=1, cex=.2)\n\nhist(zb,breaks=15, col=\"blue\", prob= TRUE, main=\"December North Pacific SSTs, 15 breaks\", xlab=\"Z-score\")\ncurve(dnorm(x, mean=mean(zb), sd=sd(zb)), \n          col=\"black\", lwd=2, add=TRUE, yaxt=\"n\")\nlegend(\"topleft\", ncol=2, legend=c(\"15 breaks\"), col=c(\"blue\"), lwd=1, cex=.2)\n\ntitle(\"SST Events (El Nino vs. Blob) Normality Tests\", outer=TRUE)\n```\nThe data for both El Nino and NorthEast Pacific appear to be skewed in different directions. El Nino with breaks = 20 appears to be positively skewed with positive outlier z-scores nearing 3. NorthEast Pacific appears to be negatively skewed with negative outlier z-scores nearing -3. These outliers occur towards the beginning (1910s) and end (2010s) of our dataset. We may want to remove them because they are statistically significant. If we were just looking at the correlation between the sea surface temperatures of the two regions, it would make sense. However, if we want to model the large change as well as the correlation, we should leave them in. In this case, the 'wider' bin sizes seems abstract out some jitter but can abstract away important information (such as how the NorthEast Pacific region has gaps on either side of the mean within the 20 bin; this isn't seen in the 15 bin).\n\n\n###4)###\n```{r, echo=FALSE}\npar( mfrow = c(1,2))\nqqnorm(zn,main= \"El Nino \")\nqqline(zn, col= \"red\")\n\nqqnorm(zb, main= \"NorthEast Pacific\")\nqqline(zb, col= \"blue\")\n```\nWhile the majority of the data does seem to follow the QQlines, neither set of data suggests normaility. This can easily be seen by the skewed tails on both ends of both plots. This shouldn't come as a surprise since, based on the plots in *2)*, we see the early decades and that latest decade appear to deviate. This data should be checked with p-values and other statistics to determine if it is normally distributed. Until now, we have made the assumption that it is a normally distributed population. However, if our population isn't normal, our 'skewed' tails may not be as statistically relevant.\n\n\n\n##SECTION 2: California Precipitation##\n\n###5)###\n![Figure 1](/Users/Thomas/Desktop/table.png)\n```{r, echo=FALSE}\ndec_wholeCa = dat[,4]\ndec_wholeCa_mean = mean(dec_wholeCa)\ndec_wholeCa_sd = sd(dec_wholeCa)\ndec_wholeCa_CoV = dec_wholeCa_sd/dec_wholeCa_mean\n\ndec_NorCal = dat[,5]\ndec_NorCal_mean = mean(dec_NorCal)\ndec_NorCal_sd = sd(dec_NorCal)\ndec_NorCal_CoV = dec_NorCal_sd/dec_NorCal_mean\n\ndec_SoCal = dat[,6]\ndec_SoCal_mean = mean(dec_SoCal)\ndec_SoCal_sd = sd(dec_SoCal)\ndec_SoCal_CoV = dec_SoCal_sd/dec_SoCal_mean\n\ndjfm_wholeCa = dat[,7]\ndjfm_wholeCa_mean = mean(head(djfm_wholeCa,-1))\ndjfm_wholeCa_sd = sd(head(djfm_wholeCa,-1))\ndjfm_wholeCa_CoV = djfm_wholeCa_sd/djfm_wholeCa_mean\n\ndjfm_NorCal = dat[,8]\ndjfm_NorCal_mean = mean(head(djfm_NorCal,-1))\ndjfm_NorCal_sd = sd(head(djfm_NorCal,-1))\ndjfm_NorCal_CoV = djfm_NorCal_sd/djfm_NorCal_mean\n\ndjfm_SoCal = dat[,9]\ndjfm_SoCal_mean = mean(head(djfm_SoCal,-1))\ndjfm_SoCal_sd = sd(head(djfm_SoCal,-1))\ndjfm_SoCal_CoV = djfm_SoCal_sd/djfm_SoCal_mean\n```\nThe northern regions appear more variable. Since standard deviation is the square root of variance, Northern California in both December alone and throughout our winter observations (Dec - Mar), has a higher variance of precipitation. Based on historical knowledge, it makes sense that there may be more variance as Norther California also usually recieves more rain. As seen in our Southern California December mean of 1.293in, there is little rain to be observed and we would likely see larger variation later on into the wet season (and possibly into Spring).\nHowever, it can clearly be seen through comparison of Dec and DJFM that the DJFM data has larger variation for all region averages. Once again, this is to be expected since Dec is usually just the beginning of greater California's wet season, and we would expect to see more variance with more, but not a lot, of data. Lastly, month-to-month variation shows weak correlation, suggesting that DJFM results would produce more variance.\n\n\n###6) & 7)###\n```{r, echo=FALSE}\npar(mfrow = c(2,2)) \npar(oma=c(0,0,2,0))\n\nhist(dat[,5],breaks = 20, main = \"NoCal Dec\", col=\"green\", prob=TRUE, xlab=\"Precipitation [in]\")\ncurve(dnorm(x, mean=mean(dat[,5]), sd=sd(dat[,5])), \n          col=\"black\", lwd=2, add=TRUE, yaxt=\"n\")\n\ngrid(nx = NULL, ny = NULL, col = \"lightgray\", lty = \"dotted\",\n     lwd = par(\"lwd\"), equilogs = TRUE)\n\nqqnorm(dat[,5], main= \"NoCal Dec\")\nqqline (dat[,5], col=\"green\")\n\nhist(dat[,6],breaks = 20, main = \"SoCal Dec\", col=\"orange\", prob=TRUE, xlab=\"Precipitation [in]\")\ncurve(dnorm(x, mean=mean(dat[,6]), sd=sd(dat[,6])), \n          col=\"black\", lwd=2, add=TRUE, yaxt=\"n\")\n\ngrid(nx = NULL, ny = NULL, col = \"lightgray\", lty = \"dotted\",\n     lwd = par(\"lwd\"), equilogs = TRUE)\n\nqqnorm(dat[,6], main= \" SoCal Dec\")\nqqline (dat[,6], col=\"orange\")\n\ntitle(\"December California Precipitation\", outer=TRUE)\n```\nThe NorCal distribution doesn't appear normal and has a positive skew. The SoCal distribution appears even less normal with a positive skew. In both cases, the two tails appear to be fit the worst. Once again, this makes sense since our extreme events tended to be towards the tails. Both tails have events that are 3 - 4 times the plotted curve mean.\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE}\npar( mfrow = c( 2, 1))\n\n\nhist(dat[,5], breaks=20, main= \"NorCal Average Precipitation\", col= \"lightgray\",\nxlab = \"NorCal Precip [inches]\", prob= TRUE)\n\ngrid(nx = NULL, ny = NULL, col = \"lightgray\", lty = \"dotted\",\n     lwd = par(\"lwd\"), equilogs = TRUE)\nlines(c(dat[116,5],dat[116,5]),c(0,20),col =\"red\")\ncurve(dnorm(x, mean=mean(dat[,5]), sd=sd(dat[,5])), \n          col=\"darkblue\", lwd=2, add=TRUE, yaxt=\"n\")\n\nhist(dat[,6], breaks=20, main= \"SoCal Average Precipitation\", col= \"lightgray\",\nxlab = \"SoCal Precip [inches]\", prob=TRUE)\n\ngrid(nx = NULL, ny = NULL, col = \"lightgray\", lty = \"dotted\",\n     lwd = par(\"lwd\"), equilogs = TRUE)\nlines(c(dat[116,6],dat[116,6]),c(0,20),col =\"red\", main= \"SoCal Average Precipitation\")\ncurve(dnorm(x, mean=mean(dat[,6]), sd=sd(dat[,6])), \n          col=\"darkblue\", lwd=2, add=TRUE, yaxt=\"n\")\n\ntitle(\"Average Precipitation Normality Tests\", outer=TRUE)\n\nsum(dat[116,5]<dat[,5])\nsum(dat[116,6]<dat[,6])\n```\nSimilar to some of the histogram plots before, we see that the distributions are positively skewed and that the frequency (density) fluctuates quite a bit. The (red) 2015 line seems somewhat likely in NorCal because it seems within one standard deviation of the mean. However, SoCal seems much less likley since it is much closer to 0 than the mean, and between relatively 'averaged' hight density bars. However, even though the bar is quite far to the right for SoCal, our sum function observes that there were 85/115 years in SoCal where there was less precipitation than in 2015. This is a relatively high number compared to NorCal's 36/115, suggesting that maybe SoCal's 2015 extreme rain isn't as extreme as we originally considered. This needs to be further investigated.\n\n\n###8)###\n```{r, echo=FALSE}\nlibrary(MASS)\n?fitdistr\n\nfitdistr(dat[1:115,8],\"gamma\")\np_NoCal_DJFM = pgamma(dat[1:115,8],8.87,0.44)\nz_NoCal_DJFM = qnorm(p_NoCal_DJFM)\n\nfitdistr(dat[1:115,9],\"gamma\")\np_SoCal_DJFM = pgamma(dat[1:115,9],3.78,0.63)\nz_SoCal_DJFM = qnorm(p_SoCal_DJFM)\n\n#Question #8:\n\npar( mfrow = c(2,2))\npar(oma=c(0,0,2,0))\n\nhist(z_NoCal_DJFM, breaks=20,density=10, col=\"orange\", \n\tmain=\"Northern California Dec-Mar Precip\",\n\txlab = \"Z-Score\", prob=TRUE)\n\ngrid(nx = NULL, ny = NULL, col = \"lightgray\", lty = \"dotted\",\n     lwd = par(\"lwd\"), equilogs = TRUE)\n\ncurve(dnorm(x, mean=mean(z_NoCal_DJFM), sd=sd(z_NoCal_DJFM)), \n          col=\"darkblue\", lwd=2, add=TRUE, yaxt=\"n\")\n\n\nqqnorm(z_NoCal_DJFM, main= \"NoCal Dec-Mar Precip\")\nqqline (z_NoCal_DJFM, col=\"orange\")\n\n\nhist(z_SoCal_DJFM, breaks=20,density=10, col=\"purple\",\n\tmain=\"Southern California Dec-Mar Precip\",\n\txlab = \"Z-Score\", prob=TRUE)\ncurve(dnorm(x, mean=mean(z_SoCal_DJFM), sd=sd(z_NoCal_DJFM)), \n          col=\"darkblue\", lwd=2, add=TRUE, yaxt=\"n\")\n\ngrid(nx = NULL, ny = NULL, col = \"lightgray\", lty = \"dotted\",\n     lwd = par(\"lwd\"), equilogs = TRUE)\n\nqqnorm(z_SoCal_DJFM, main= \"SoCal Dec-Mar Precip\")\nqqline (z_SoCal_DJFM, col=\"purple\")\n\ntitle(\"December-March Precipitation Normality Tests\", outer=TRUE)\n```\nBased on the figures produced, the plots are fairly normal. NorCal ppears to have a bit of a negative skew, but SoCal appears quite normal (with a small dip just above the mean). In addition, when looking at QQnorm, we see fewer outliers than in previus QQnorm plots, suggesting a more normal distribution as well.\n\n\n###9)###\n```{r, echo=FALSE}\npar( mfrow = c(2,2))\npar(oma=c(0,0,2,0))\n\nplot(zn[1:115],z_NoCal_DJFM, col=\"red\", xlab=\"El Nino SST Z-Score\",ylab=\"DJFM Precip Z-Score\", main=\"NorCal\")\ngrid(nx = NULL, ny = NULL, col = \"lightgray\", lty = \"dotted\",\n     lwd = par(\"lwd\"), equilogs = TRUE)\nabline(lm(z_NoCal_DJFM~zn[1:115]), col=\"red\")\n\n\nplot(zn[1:115],z_SoCal_DJFM, col= \"red\", xlab=\"El Nino SST Z-Score\",ylab=\"DJFM Precip Z-Score\", main=\"SoCal\")\ngrid(nx = NULL, ny = NULL, col = \"lightgray\", lty = \"dotted\",\n     lwd = par(\"lwd\"), equilogs = TRUE)\nabline(lm(z_SoCal_DJFM~zn[1:115]), col=\"red\")\n\n\nplot(zb[1:115],z_NoCal_DJFM, col = \"blue\", xlab=\"NorthEast Pacific SST Z-Score\",ylab=\"DJFM Precip Z-Score\", main=\"NorCal\")\ngrid(nx = NULL, ny = NULL, col = \"lightgray\", lty = \"dotted\",\n     lwd = par(\"lwd\"), equilogs = TRUE)\nabline(lm(z_NoCal_DJFM~zb[1:115]), col=\"blue\")\n\n\nplot(zb[1:115],z_SoCal_DJFM, col = \"blue\", xlab=\"NorthEast Pacific SST Z-Score\",ylab=\"DJFM Precip Z-Score\", main=\"SoCal\")\ngrid(nx = NULL, ny = NULL, col = \"lightgray\", lty = \"dotted\",\n     lwd = par(\"lwd\"), equilogs = TRUE)\nabline(lm(z_SoCal_DJFM~zb[1:115]), col=\"blue\")\n\ntitle(\"Event SST & DJFM California Precipitation\", outer=TRUE)\n```\nAll four of these plots for NorCal & SoCal precipitation vs El Nino & NorthEast Pacific SST Z-scores are not very conclusive. While a line shows a roughly positive correlation during El Nino and a roughly negative one during NorthEast Pacific, all four plots are quite random. This suggest that the SSTs both arn't heavily relatived to the 'wet season' precipitation, and that El Nino events and NorthEast pacific events aren't correlated.\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE}\npar(mfrow = c(1,1))\n\nplot(dat[,5][1:115],z_NoCal_DJFM,\n\tylab= \"December Precipitation\",\n\txlab= \"Dec-Mar Average Precipition\",\n\tmain= \"Northern California Precipitation\")\ngrid(nx = NULL, ny = NULL, col = \"lightgray\", lty = \"dotted\",\n     lwd = par(\"lwd\"), equilogs = TRUE)\nabline(lm(z_NoCal_DJFM~dat[,5][1:115]), col=\"red\")\n\n\nplot(dat[,6][1:115],z_SoCal_DJFM,\n\tylab= \"December Precipitation\",\n\txlab= \"Dec-Mar Average Precipition\",\n\tmain= \"Southern California Precipitation\")\ngrid(nx = NULL, ny = NULL, col = \"lightgray\", lty = \"dotted\",\n     lwd = par(\"lwd\"), equilogs = TRUE)\nabline(lm(z_SoCal_DJFM~dat[,6][1:115]), col=\"red\")\n```\nWhile the Z-scores don't appear to show much, when plotting raw precipitation, it is certainly clear that December & DJFM precipitation is correlated in both NorCal and SoCal. Since these time periods aren't mutually exclusive, it makes sense that December, the beginning of the 'wet season' time period, would act as a good predictor for the following months.\n\n\n###10)###\nUnline Z-scores, a t-test will allow us to look at and compare the differences between means and samples of two groups. In this case, we are first observing NorCal within and outside of El Nino events. Based on the code provided, we can determine a **t-value = 1.6009** with a **p-value = 0.1473** for NorCal. This is not statistically significant since our alpha avalues are above 0.05. There isn't a statistical difference within and outside of El Nino events. The standardized means for El Nino and non El Nino are 0.62662480 -0.04601675 respectively.\nFor our second test observing SoCal, we produce a **t-value = 2.145** with a **p-value = 0.065**. Once again, this p-value is greater than our alpha of 0.05, and isn't statistically significant (at our desired confidence interval level). These are both physically significant because they suggest that these 'heavy rainfall' and heavier weather events won't actually affect California. The standardized means for El Nino and non El Nino are 0.8056689 -0.1762075 respectively.These means show variation from our original information, but show little impactful correlation.\n\n\n```{r}\nnino_z_NoCal_DJFM = z_NoCal_DJFM[zn[1:115] > 1.5]\nnino_z_SoCal_DJFM = z_SoCal_DJFM[zn[1:115] > 1.5]\n\nnon_nino_z_NoCal_DJFM = z_NoCal_DJFM[zn[1:115] <0]\nnon_nino_z_SoCal_DJFM = z_SoCal_DJFM[zn[1:115] <0]\n\nt.test(nino_z_NoCal_DJFM, non_nino_z_NoCal_DJFM)\nt.test(nino_z_SoCal_DJFM, non_nino_z_SoCal_DJFM)\n```\n\n\n###11)###\nNext we observe the two California regions, but with and without NorthEast Pacific events. With NorCal, we determine a **t-value = 0.942** with a **p-value = 0.359**. Similar to results of NorCal within and outside the NorthEast Pacific events, there isn't statistical significance at our observation level.\nThe standardized means for NorthEast Pacific and non NorthEast Pacific are 0.35364282 0.01425918  respectively.\nFor SoCal, we get a **t-value = 0.841** with a **p-value = 0.423**. Once again, at our level there is no statistical significance. The standardized means for NorthEast Pacific and non NorthEast Pacific are 0.31261798 -0.05916796 respectively. These means show variation from our original information, but show little impactful correlation. Therefore, these are both physically significant because they suggest that these 'heavy rainfall' and heavier weather events won't actually affect California. Now, if we were to observe at an alpha level = 0.01, then we may begin to consider all of these events.\n```{r}\nblobbo_z_NoCal_DJFM = z_NoCal_DJFM[zb[1:115] > 1.5]\nblobbo_z_SoCal_DJFM = z_SoCal_DJFM[zb[1:115] > 1.5]\n\nnon_blobbo_z_NoCal_DJFM = z_NoCal_DJFM[zb[1:115] <0]\nnon_blobbo_z_SoCal_DJFM = z_SoCal_DJFM[zb[1:115] <0]\n\nt.test(blobbo_z_NoCal_DJFM, non_blobbo_z_NoCal_DJFM)\nt.test(blobbo_z_SoCal_DJFM, non_blobbo_z_SoCal_DJFM)\n```\n\n\n###12)###\nIn this case, we were observing another phenomena, trying to look at differences just within December, wet and dry. A December is considered dry if there was less than 3in of precipitation, and wet is anything greater than 5in. For NorCal, we get a **t-value = -5.176** with a **p-value = w.375e-6**. Unlike our observations before, this is a very significant result. We can determine that there is a much stronger correlation between wet December and a wet DJFM. Depending on who you are talking to, this may be physically significant. I don't think that it is because it makes sense that a we starting month would result in a wetter overall season. On the otherhand, in SoCal, we define dry as less than 1.5in and wet is greater than 7in. We get a **t-value = -3.405** with a significant **p-value = 0.001**. Similar to NorCal, this doesn't seem very physically significant for similar reasons. The standardized means for NorCal and SoCal wet and dry are -0.6303173, 0.4447153 and -0.3588874, 0.3856136 respectively.\n```{r}\ndrydec_z_NoCal_DJFM = z_NoCal_DJFM[dat[1:115,5] < 3]\ndrydec_z_SoCal_DJFM = z_SoCal_DJFM[dat[1:115,6]<.7]\n\nnon_drydec_z_NoCal_DJFM = z_NoCal_DJFM[dat[1:115,5]>5]\nnon_drydec_z_SoCal_DJFM = z_SoCal_DJFM[dat[1:115,6]>1.5]\n\nt.test(drydec_z_NoCal_DJFM, non_drydec_z_NoCal_DJFM)\nt.test(drydec_z_SoCal_DJFM, non_drydec_z_SoCal_DJFM)\n```\n\n\n###13)###\nT-tests are quite valuable and produced important results. It is clear that December precipitation in both regions can be good indicators as what's to come for the remainder of the 'wet season'. This should make sense because it is the preliminary driver of the weathe for the season. However, it seems as though the El Nino and NorthEast Pacific events aren't as influential in the DJFM precipitation level. This may be due to the fact that El Nino and NorthEast Pacific events fluctuate frequently just like precipitation, and further correlation needs to be investigated. However, I think that there may be a greater temporal element at the root (Athropogenic Climate Disruption... or 'Climate Change'). We have used common but strong statistical tests to produce these results, however it is still hard to say if this year's 2015/2016 season will an 'outlier' as well, or if it will make the 2015 results seem to fit more into a normal distribution (if the 2015/2016 data is even more extreme). For this reason, I think it may be hard to predict the DJFM precipitation, however, looking at our current rainfall and the wet indicators of last year, it seems more likely that it will be a wetter season.",
